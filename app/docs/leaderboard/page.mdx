## Curta Puzzles

<Callout intent="neutral">
  100% of the solve data is [stored onchain](https://github.com/waterfall-mkt/curta/blob/ab09821aaad6b5f3c05cccb0ded294c1dc222046/src/FlagsERC721.sol#L101-L117), so anyone can make their own leaderboard.
</Callout>

This section describes how the leaderboard is ranked for [Curta Puzzles](/docs/puzzles/overview).

### Points

Players are first ranked by the [Phase](/docs/puzzles/overview#submission-period) they completed it in. The earlier the Phase, the more points awarded:

- Phase 0 <span className='text-gray-200'>-></span> 3 points
- Phase 1 <span className='text-gray-200'>-></span> 2 points
- Phase 2 <span className='text-gray-200'>-></span> 1 points

For example if a player has 2 Phase 0 solves, 4 Phase 1 solves, and 1 Phase 2 solve, they'll have 15 points:
```none showLineNumbers={false}
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 2 Phase 0 solves
┃     ┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 4 Phase 1 solves
┃     ┃     ┏━━━━━━━━━━ 1 Phase 2 solve
2*3 + 4*2 + 1*1 = 15
  ┃     ┃     ┗━━━━━━━━ 1 point
  ┃     ┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 2 points
  ┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 3 points
```

<Callout intent="primary">
  You can find the implementation [here](https://github.com/waterfall-mkt/curta.wtf/blob/9b2a127acc79eecb18ad43e2cdcf7839f03a007c/lib/utils/fetchLeaderboardPuzzles.ts#L94-L107).
</Callout>

### Speed Score

Next, for tiebreakers, the leaderboard sorts by the average rank each player finished in with the following formula:

$$
100\cdot\left(1-\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\mathrm{rank}(i)-1}{\max(1,\max(1, \mathrm{total\_solves}(i))-1)}}{n}\right)
$$

</Callout>

### Seasons

The leaderboard resets with a new **season** every 5 puzzles to allow newcomers to be competitive and reduce the stress of maintaining a position on the all-time leaderboard. The UI displays the current season by default, but it has options to view all [past seasons](/leaderboard?puzzles-season=1), as well as the [all-time leaderboard](/leaderboard?puzzles-season=all):

  The all-time leaderboard excludes puzzles that are part of an event from its ranking.
