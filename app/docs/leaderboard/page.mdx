# Leaderboard

On Curta, anyone can make their own leaderboards because all solve data is on-chain. We designed [our leaderboard](/leaderboard) to rank players by the **Phase** they completed it first (via **Points**), then by how fast their solve was relative to others (via **Speed Score**).

## Points

Our leaderboard weighs solves in earlier [Phases](/docs/phases) higher because it implies a more skilled solve:

- Phase 0 $\rightarrow$ 3 points
- Phase 1 $\rightarrow$ 2 points
- Phase 2 $\rightarrow$ 1 points

For example, if a player has $\color{red}{2}$ Phase 0 solves, $\color{green}{4}$ Phase 1 solves, and $\color{orange}{1}$ Phase 2 solves, they'll have 15 points:

$$
({\color{red}{2}}\cdot3)+({\color{green}{4}}\cdot2)+({\color{orange}{1}}\cdot1) = 15
$$

## Speed Score

Next, for tiebreakers, the leaderboard sorts by the average rank each player finished in via the following formula:

$$
100\cdot\left(1-\frac{\sum_{i=0}^{n}\frac{\mathrm{rank}(i)-1}{\max(1, \mathrm{total}(i))}}{n}\right)
$$
