# Flag Token

**Flag Tokens** are ERC-721 tokens that represent valid solutions to a puzzle and are the base reward for solving a puzzle. The art for each Flag is generated on-chain, and it takes the [Phase](/docs/phases) it was solved in into account. Additionally, each Flag contains the following attributes:

| Attribute   | Description                                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Puzzle name | Name of the puzzle                           |
| Author      | Address that added the puzzle                |
| Phase       | Phase it was solved in                       |
| Solver      | Address that minted the Flag                 |
| Solve time  | Number of seconds since the puzzle was added |
| Rank        | Solve position within the puzzle             |
