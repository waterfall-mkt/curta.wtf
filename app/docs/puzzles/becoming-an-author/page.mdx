# Becoming an Author

<Description children={description} />

## Authorship Token

To become an author, you must have an unused Authorship Token and [write + add a puzzle to Curta](/docs/writing-puzzles).

<Callout intent="warning">
  After an Authorship Token has been used to add a puzzle, it doesn't get burnt, but it can never be used again.
</Callout>

## Obtaining Authorship Tokens

There are only 3 ways to obtain Authorship Tokens:
1. be the first solver to any puzzle,
2. purchase them on a [secondary marketplace](https://opensea.io/collection/authorship),
3. or receive from the team.

The Curta contract allows its `owner` to mint an Authorship Token every 3 days (initialized at deploy). Currently, `owner` is the Curta team. If you'd like to receive an Authorship Token to write a puzzle, reach out to us [@curta_ctf](https://twitter.com/curta_ctf).

  These mechanisms help retain the quality of Curta puzzles as new authors are added.
