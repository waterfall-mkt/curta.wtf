# Submitting Solutions

<Description children={description} />

## Using the UI

First, locate the solution form on the puzzle page:

<ComponentsDisplay>
  <div className='max-w-[20rem] bg-gray-600 rounded-[1.25rem] border border-stroke'>
    <PuzzleInfoSolutionForm
      puzzle={{
        firstSolveTimestamp: Date.now() / 1000 - 86400,
        author: {
          address: '0xA85572Cd96f1643458f17340b6f0D6549Af482F5',
          ensName: 'fiveoutofnine.eth',
        },
      }}
    />
  </div>
</ComponentsDisplay>

Then, paste your solution into the input box and click **Submit**. Although this should be enough for most puzzles, the UI also provides advanced options to configure the amount of ETH and gas limit sent with the solve transaction.

### Tipping the author

The **Tip author** button lets you configure the amount of ETH sent with the submission. Initially, the form autopopulates with the minimum amount required to submit a solution: 0.02 ETH during Phase 2; 0 ETH during all other Phases.

<Callout intent="neutral">
  By having a _minimum_ fee rather than a fixed fee, players can choose to "tip" authors they respect/to show support.
</Callout>

### Configuring the transaction

The **Edit** button lets you configure the gas limit and whether to simulate the transaction before enabling the submit button.

<Callout intent="neutral">
  Disabling means the UI will let you submit the transaction regardless of the results fetched via [`usePrepareContractWrite`](https://wagmi.sh/react/prepare-hooks/usePrepareContractWrite).
</Callout>

## Calling the contract

To submit a solution by directly interacting with the [Curta contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0000000006bC8D9e5e9d436217B88De704a9F307#writeContract), call `solve(uint32,uint256)`. This is helpful when the solution is complex (e.g. requires specific block number, multiple transactions/contract deploys, etc.) and more easily accomplished via a script.

```sol showLineNumbers={false}
/// @notice Mints an NFT if the provided solution solves the puzzle.
/// @param _puzzleId The ID of the puzzle.
/// @param _solution The solution.
function solve(uint32 _puzzleId, uint256 _solution) external;
```

<Callout intent="primary">
  Note that the transaction must be sent with a value of at least 0.02 ETH if the puzzle is in [Phase 2](/docs/puzzles/overview#submission-period).
</Callout>
