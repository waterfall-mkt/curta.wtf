# Becoming an Author

To become an author, you must have an unused [Authorship Token](/docs/authorship-token) and [create a puzzle](/guides/author/creating-a-puzzle).

## Obtaining Authorship Tokens

There are only 3 ways to obtain Authorship Tokens:

1. be the first solver to any puzzle,
2. purchase them on secondary,
3. or receive from the team.

### Team Distribution

Curta allows the owner to mint an Authorship Token every 3 days (initialized at deploy). Currently, the owner is the Curta team. The tokens will be distributed to devs that display excellence in the following traits:

- Technical expertise
- Experience
- Contribution to the ecosystem
- Passion
- Impact
