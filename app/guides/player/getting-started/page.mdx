# Getting Started

## Navigating Around the Frontend

On the [**home page**](/), you can view ongoing and past puzzles, which you can filter by [**Phase**](/docs/phases) (Phase 0, 1, and 2 mean ongoing; Phase 3 means over):

## How to Compete

Once you've clicked on a puzzle, you'll be brought to its puzzle page. Here, you can read through the source code and try to solve the puzzle. Keep in mind that each puzzle takes in players' addresses as a seed, so you'll have to solve it for the address you connected to the site with.
