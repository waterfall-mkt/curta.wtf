# NFT Rewards

## Flag Tokens

[Flag Tokens](/docs/flag-token) are NFTs and are the base reward for solving a puzzle on Curta. They include your performance stats as metadata and act as a token of accomplishment.

## Authorship Tokens

If you are the first solver to any puzzle, you will be rewarded with an [Authorship Token](/docs/authorship-token), which you can use to create and add your own puzzle to the protocol. You can only use it to add a puzzle once, but after using it, you'll still own it (i.e. it doesn't get burnt). See [Becoming an Author](/guides/author/becoming-an-author) and [Authorship Token](/docs/authorship-token) for more information.
